	Abstract = {Despite the many advantages of private car travel, excessive use of the private car has many negative consequences, such as congestion and air pollution. There is widespread recognition of the need to limit the demand for private car travel through travel demand management measures, such as information and incentives. This study examines the effectiveness of Let's Carpool, an initiative aimed at increasing vehicle occupancy in the Wellington region of New Zealand, and it examines factors related to solo driving. Let's Carpool uses ride-matching software to facilitate finding a carpool match for the commute to and from work. This evaluation study among nearly 1300 registrants of Let's Carpool shows that the percentage of commuters enrolled in the scheme who carpooled as their main mode of transport for getting to work increased significantly (from 12% to 27%), while the percentage of commuters indicating they drove alone decreased significantly. The frequency of driving alone also decreased significantly. Beliefs about cost, comfort, and convenience were related to solo driving. Based on the findings, recommendations are made to further enhance the effect of carpool initiatives. },

	Abstract = {Carpooling is a transport system based on a shared use of private cars. The mobility managers of the Universit{\`a} Statale and Politecnico di Milano universities are interested in promoting the use of such system among their students and employees. The paper presents an ongoing project to design, implement and test PoliUniPool, a car pooling service for such universities. The main characteristics of the PoliUniPool service are the following: (1) the use of the system is restricted to employees, faculty and students of the two universities; (2) besides suggesting a matching between the users, the system provides the expected schedule for their trips; (3) in addition to the campus premises, users can select -- as destination of their car pooling trips -- the main railway and subway stations, in order to encourage the most environmental friendly means; (4) users are informed immediately in case of delay or changes, to improve the reliability of the service; (5) the system estimates the costs for each user, in order to let the users know how to share them; (6) the system has some social network functionalities, e.g. drivers are able to set partial pre-arranged crews; and users may indicate other users they would prefer to car-pool with (``friends'') or they don't want to (``I don't like him/her''). A web-based software tool has been implemented to manage the matching of the users. In order to solve the carpooling problem, we use an heuristics, based on a guided Monte Carlo method. The algorithm minimizes an objective function, subject to user time windows and car capacity constraints. The objective function is a weighted sum of different terms in order to maximize the number of served users, minimizing the total route length, and maximizing the satisfied user preferences (e.g. friends). The result is a matching between drivers and passengers, their schedules and the routes to be driven by each driver. The trial of the proposed service will start on September 2011 and will take into account how to introduce and promote the service, identifying regulation, incentives, modalities, and marketing actions. },

@article{Yan2011512,
	Abstract = {Most past car pooling studies have focused on the to-work problem (from different origins to a common destination) or the return-from-work problem (from the same origin to different destinations). Pre-matching information, including the carpool partners and the route/schedule for each previously participating vehicle, have rarely been considered. As a result, there has not yet been a suitable method/model developed for solving practical many-to-many car pooling problem with multiple vehicle and person types, as well as pre-matching information, that occur in real-world. In this study we strive to make up this lack by employing a time--space network flow technique to develop a model for this type of car pooling problem with pre-matching information (CPPPMI). The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. A solution algorithm, based on Lagrangian relaxation and a heuristic for the upper bound solution, is developed to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm may be applied to real-world, numerical tests are performed with several problem instances randomly generated based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. },

	Abstract = {Carpooling can cut costs and help to solve congestion problems but does not seem to be popular. Behavioral models allow to study the incentives and inhibitors for carpooling and the aggregated effect on the transportation system. In activity based modeling used for travel forecasting, cooperation between actors is important both for schedule planning and revision. Carpooling requires cooperation while commuting which in turn involves co-scheduling and co-routing. The latter requires combinatorial optimization. Agent-based systems used for activity based modeling, contain large amounts of agents. The agent model requires helper algorithms that deliver high quality solutions to embedded optimisation problems using a small amount of resources. Those algorithms are invoked thousands of times during agent society evolution and schedule execution simulation. Solution quality shall be sufficient in order to guarantee realistic agent behavior. This paper focuses on the co-routing problem. },

@article{Bellemans20121221,
	Abstract = {Carpooling is thought to be part of the solution to resolve traffic congestion in regions where large companies dominate the traffic situation because coordination and matching between commuters is more likely to be feasible in cases where most people work for a single employer. Moreover, carpooling is not very popular for commuting. In order for carpooling to be successful, an online service for matching commuter profiles is indispensable due to the large community involved. Such service is necessary but not sufficient because carpooling requires rerouting and activity rescheduling along with candidate matching. We advise to introduce services of this kind using a two step process: (1) an agentbased simulation is used to investigate opportunities and inhibitors and (2) online matching is made available. This paper describes the challenges to build the model and in particular investigates possibilities to derive the data required for commuter behavior modeling from big data (such as GSM, \{GPS\} and/or Bluetooth). },

@article{Cho2012801,
	Abstract = {Carpooling is an emerging alternative transportation mode that is eco-friendly and sustainable as it enables commuters to save time, travel resource, reduce emission and traffic congestion. The procedure of carpooling consists of a number of steps namely (i) create a motive to carpool, (ii) communicate this motive with other interested agents, (iii) negotiate a plan with the interested agents, (iv) execute the agreed plans and (v) provide a feedback to all concerned agents. The state-of-the-art research work on agent-based modeling is limited to a number of technical and empirical studies that are unable to handle the complex agent behavior in terms of coordination, communication and negotiations. In this paper we present a conceptual design of an agent-based model (ABM) for the carpooling application that serves as a proof of concept. Our agent-based model for the carpooling application is a computational model that is used for simulating the interactions of autonomous agents and to analyze the effects of change in factors related to the infrastructure, behavior and cost. In our agent-based carpooling application we use agent profiles and social networks to initiate our agent communication model and then employ a route matching algorithm and a utility function to trigger the negotiation process between agents. We plan to, as a part of the future work, develop a prototype of our agent-based carpooling application on the basis of the work presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also intend to carry out a validation study of our results with real data. },

	Abstract = {Carpooling is an emerging alternative transportation mode that is eco-friendly and sustainable as it enables commuters to save time, travel resource, reduce emission and traffic congestion. The procedure of carpooling consists of a number of steps namely; (i) create a motive to carpool, (ii) communicate this motive with other agents, (iii) negotiate a plan with the interested agents, (iv) execute the agreed plans, and (v) provide a feedback to all concerned agents. In this paper, we present a conceptual design of an agent-based model (ABM) for the carpooling a that serves as a proof of concept. Our model for the carpooling application is a computational model that is used for simulating the interactions of autonomous agents and to analyze the effects of change in factors related to the infrastructure, behavior and cost. In our carpooling application, we use agent profiles and social networks to initiate our agent communication model and then employ a route matching algorithm, and a utility function to trigger the negotiation process between agents. We developed a prototype of our agent-based carpooling application based on the work presented in this paper and carried out a validation study of our results with real data collected in Flanders, Belgium. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Carpooling is an emerging alternative transportation mode that is eco-friendly and sustainable as it enables commuters to save time, travel resource, reduce emission and traffic congestion. The procedure of carpooling consists of a number of steps namely; (i) create a motive to carpool, (ii) communicate this motive with other agents, (iii) negotiate a plan with the interested agents, (iv) execute the agreed plans, and (v) provide a feedback to all concerned agents. The state-of-the-art research work on agent-based modeling is limited to a number of technical and empirical studies that are unable to handle the complex agent behavior in terms of coordination, communication and negotiations. In this paper, we present a conceptual design of an agent-based model (ABM) for the carpooling a that serves as a proof of concept. Our model for the carpooling application is a computational model that is used for simulating the interactions of autonomous agents and to analyze the effects of change in factors related to the infrastructure, behavior and cost. In our carpooling application, we use agent profiles and social networks to initiate our agent communication model and then employ a route matching algorithm, and a utility function to trigger the negotiation process between agents. We plan to, as a part of the future work, develop a prototype of our agent-based carpooling application based on the work presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also intend to carry out a validation study of our results with real data. },

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>From humans to social insects and bacteria, decision-making is often influenced by some form of collective signaling, be it quorum, information exchange, pledges or announcements. Here we investigate how such <italic>signaling</italic> systems evolve when collective action entails a public good, and how meanings co-evolve with individual choices, given Nature's most prevalent states. We find a rich scenario, showing how natural selection is able to evolve a costly quorum signaling system that allows individuals to coordinate their action so as to provide the appropriate response to different states of Nature. We show that signaling robustly and selectively promotes cooperative collective action when coordinated action is most needed. In light of our results, and despite the complexity that collective action relying on quorum signaling may entail, it is not so surprising how signaling is a ubiquitous property of the living world.</p>},

	Abstract = {Users play an essential role in the early development and diffusion phases of an innovation. Citizen groups may directly influence user-relevant characteristics of a new technology. They may actively engage in the social construction of quality characteristics, the perception of costs and the development of specific use forms and product images. By this they create `technological niches' where essential learning processes for the further development of the technology may take place. This contribution may not be copied by more professional actors or, if so, only with considerable difficulty. This article illustrates these claims by referring to the development of a user-led innovation and diffusion process in the domain of individual transport: the emergence of organized car sharing in Switzerland. This innovation started in two neighbourhood-based experiments in the late 1980s. Today, it is run by a professional service enterprise, serves some 50,000 customers around the country and continues to expand at a considerable pace. The article highlights the specific contribution of users in the starting phase of organized car sharing and asks how the role of the users changed in the course of the market expansion process. It concludes by discussing the contributions of these experiences to the promotion of sustainable transport.},
